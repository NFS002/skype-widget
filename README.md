# skype-widget
A  widget designed to be placed as an iFrame on a section of a web page which acts as a booking form for students, so they can book office hour slots with their professors. It is written in python and javascript, html, css. It has two front ends (widget.html - the booking form for students, and profView.html - so the professor can see his bookings and cancel/rearrange them. ) There is also built in email functionality so each party is notified by email each time they make a booking or if their booking is cancelled.
