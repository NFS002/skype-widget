# skype-widget
A  widget designed to be placed as an iFrame on a section of a web page which acts as a booking form for students, so they can book office hour slots with their professors. It is written in python and javascript, html, css. It has two front ends (widget.html - the booking form for students, and profView.html - so the professor can see his bookings and cancel/rearrange them. ) There is also built in email functionality so each party is notified by email each time they make a booking or if their booking is cancelled. 
Note. The program requires a CGI server, as it uses CGI scripts to modify text files on the server which represent the professors available hours. The python command 'simpleCGIHTTPServer' at port 8000 works well for this purpose.
